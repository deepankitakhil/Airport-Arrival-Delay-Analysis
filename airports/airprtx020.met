  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set includes airports in the United States,
      Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The data were
      derived from the National Transportation Atlas Databases
      1997 (NTAD97) produced by U.S. Department of Transportation
      (DOT) which is based on information provided by the Federal
      Aviation Administration (FAA).  A subset of the complete
      list of airports was extracted, based on airport passenger
      enplanement of greater than or equal to 250 passengers per
      year.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis
      at the national level, and for large regional areas.  The
      data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate
      for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed
      by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Data from the NTAD97 CD-ROM were obtained from the
        Department of Transportation.  Using the airport.pnt and
        airport.t01 files on the CD-ROM, airports with passenger
        enplanement of greater than or equal to 250 passengers
        per year were selected to create a point coverage to
        which the following attributes were attached: airport
        location identifier, name of airport, name of State,
        State FIPS code, Air Carrier Activity Information System
        airports, and Total Enplanement. The data were converted
        to shapefile format for use in National Atlas
        applications and for distribution to the public.

        Airports for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin 
        Islands were added.  Airport names were changed from all
        upper case and no period after initials to lower case and 
        period after initials.  For example, LYNDON B JOHNSON is
        now Lyndon B. Johnson.
